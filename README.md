The [library.wiremock.org](https://library.wiremock.org) site provides a catalog of API Templates
that can be used with both
[WireMock](https://wiremock.org/) or [WireMock Cloud](https://wiremock.io).
You can browse our library of mock API templates and examples,
find the API that you need,
and get a running mock in seconds - on your local machine or in the cloud.

Template definitions can be found in another repository:
[wiremock/api-template-library](https://github.com/wiremock/api-template-library).

## Using templates in WireMock

1. Choose a template you need by using categorization and search capabilities of the website.
2. Click the _Download WireMock JSON_ button to download the JSON file
3. Use the JSON file to configure your WireMock instance
  ([documentation](https://wiremock.org/3.x/docs/standalone/java-jar/#json-file-configuration))

## Using templates in WireMock Cloud

For WireMock Cloud there is also the _Run in WireMock Cloud_ button that
allows to quickly import the Mock API definition into your project.
