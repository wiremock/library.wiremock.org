## If you would like to contribute

We maintain a open repository of [API templates](https://github.com/wiremock/api-template-library) that can be used with [WireMock Cloud](https://wiremock.io) or [WireMock OSS](https://wiremock.org/).

If you would like to contribute an API template to enable other WireMock users to build their own mocks based off your template then please checkout the repository.
