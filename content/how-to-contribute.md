## If you would like to contribute

We maintain a open repository of [API templates](https://github.com/wiremock/api-template-library) that can be used with [WireMock Cloud](https://wiremock.io) or [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/).
All information about templates is stored on a per-folder basis,
and the template pages provide a quick way to find an improve the template.

If you would like to contribute an API template to
enable other WireMock users to build their own mocks
based off your template then please checkout the
[Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/wiremock/library.wiremock.org-sources/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the repository.

Note that it might take some time to propagate templates from that repository to the website.

## Get Help

We have a `#help-contributing` channel on the
[WireMock Community Slack](http://slack.wiremock.org/).
