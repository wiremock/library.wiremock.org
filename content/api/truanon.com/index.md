description: "Welcome to TruAnon!\nThank you for helping make the Internet a safer\
  \ place to be.\n\nAdopting TruAnon is simple. There is no setup or dependencies,\
  \ nothing to store or process. Making identity part of your service is fun, and\
  \ youâ€™ll be up and running in a matter of minutes.\n\nTruAnon Private Token is used\
  \ anytime you request information from TruAnon and you must edit this into the Variables\
  \ section for this collection.\n\nThis API contains two endpoints and both require\
  \ these same two arguments, also found in the Variables section of this collection.\n\
  \nThese two arguments are:\n\nTruAnon Service Identifier\n\nand\n\nYour Member Name\n\
  \nYour TruAnon Service Identifier was provided by TruAnon and is likely the root\
  \ domain of your site or service. Your Member Name is the unique member ID on your\
  \ system that you would like to query.\n\nInformation is continuously updated for\
  \ display purposes and aside from performance considerations, there should be no\
  \ need to capture or save anything from TruAnon."
