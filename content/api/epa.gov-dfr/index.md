description: "Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed\
  \ and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public\
  \ use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for over\
  \ 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.\n\nDFR Rest Services provide multiple\
  \ service endpoints, to retrieve detailed facility location, enforcement, compliance\
  \ monitoring, and pollutant information for any single facility.  See the Detailed\
  \ Facility Report (DFR) Help Page (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/detailed-facility-report-help)\
  \ for additional information on the DFR.  Additionally, a Data Dictionary (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/dfr-data-dictionary)\
  \ is also available. \nThere is one primary service end point, get_dfr, that provides\
  \ all available DFR data.  All other service end points that are exposed, will return\
  \ data on a single section of the DFR.    \n\\\nAdditional ECHO Resources:   <a\
