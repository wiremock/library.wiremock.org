description: "Use these REST APIs for performing operations on NamedValue entity associated\
  \ with your Azure API Management deployment. API Management policies are a powerful\
  \ capability of the system that allow the publisher to change the behavior of the\
  \ API through configuration. Policies are a collection of statements that are executed\
  \ sequentially on the request or response of an API. Policy statements can be constructed\
  \ using literal text values, policy expressions, and NamedValues. Each API Management\
  \ service instance has a NamedValues collection of key/value pairs that are global\
  \ to the service instance. These NamedValues can be used to manage constant string\
  \ values across all API configuration and policies."
