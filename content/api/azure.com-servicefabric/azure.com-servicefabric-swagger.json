The node has to be down for this operation to be successful.

Do not run this cmdlet if the state on the node has not been removed and the node can come back up with its state intact. Starting from Service Fabric 6.5, in order to use this API for seed nodes, please change the seed nodes to regular (non-seed) nodes and then invoke this API to remove the node state. If the cluster is running on Azure, after the seed node goes down, Service Fabric will try to change it to a non-seed node automatically. To make this happen, make sure the number of non-seed nodes in the primary node type is no less than the number of Down seed nodes. If necessary, add more nodes to the primary node type to achieve this. For standalone cluster, if the Down seed node is not expected to come back up with its state intact, please remove the node from the cluster, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-windows-server-add-remove-nodes",
