description: ">ℹ️ Check the new [Payments onboarding guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/payments-overview).\
  \ We created this guide to improve the onboarding experience for developers at VTEX.\
  \ It assembles all documentation on our Developer Portal about Payments and is organized\
  \ by focusing on the developer's journey.\r\n\r\nThe Gift Card Hub API allows interactions\
  \ with all Gift Card providers registered to a store from a single point.\r\n\r\n\
  Gift Card providers are systems capable of providing cards to be used in the buying\
  \ process.\r\n\r\nThe following is the sequence diagram that represents calls in\
  \ the purchase closing process.\r\n![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/images/giftcard-hub-api-overview-0.png)\r\
  \n\r\n**Checkout + Gateway**: Systems responsible for the sale and for processing\
  \ orders and payments.\r\n\r\n**Gift Card Hub**: System responsible for managing\
  \ multiple registered Gift Card providers for a store.\r\n\r\n**Gift Card Provider**:\
  \ System responsible for providing the Gift Cards available to the user not closing\
  \ a purchase. This system can be implemented by third parties."
