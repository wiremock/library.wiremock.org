  "provider" : "interzoid.com",
  "description" : "This API provides a similarity key used to match with other similar full name data when data fields are parsed into first name and last name components, including for purposes of deduplication, fuzzy matching, or merging of datasets. A much higher match rate will be achieved by matching on the similarity key rather than the data itself. This API is for full name data where first and last name are in separate fields. Use the Full Name Similarity Key API for first and last name data that are in the same field.",
