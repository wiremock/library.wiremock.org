description: "The [Redact API](/redact/overview) helps organisations meet their privacy\
  \ compliance obligations. It provides controlled, on-demand redaction of private\
  \ information from transactional records in the long-term storage. Note, Redact\
  \ API does not have the capability to redact the short-lived server logs that are\
  \ retained for a few weeks. For SMS customers that need immediate redaction, Vonage\
  \ suggests using [Advanced Auto-redact](/redact/overview#auto-redact-vs-redact-api)."
