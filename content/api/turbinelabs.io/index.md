description: "The Turbine Labs API provides CRUD operations for core object types,\
  \ and is\nmostly RESTy. The easiest way to interact with the API is with\n[tbnctl](https://docs.turbinelabs.io/advanced/tbnctl.html).\n\
  If you want to make direct HTTP calls, however, you can obtain an access\ntoken\
  \ using tbnctl, and then pass it in the Authorization header,\nprefixed by `Token\
  \ `:\n```console\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Token <access token>\" https://api.turbinelabs.io/v1.0/cluster\n\
  ```\n"
