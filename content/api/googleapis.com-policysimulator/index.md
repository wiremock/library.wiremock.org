description: " Policy Simulator is a collection of endpoints for creating, running,\
  \ and viewing a Replay. A `Replay` is a type of simulation that lets you see how\
  \ your members' access to resources might change if you changed your IAM policy.\
  \ During a `Replay`, Policy Simulator re-evaluates, or replays, past access attempts\
  \ under both the current policy and your proposed policy, and compares those results\
  \ to determine how your members' access might change under the proposed policy."
