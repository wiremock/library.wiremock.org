  \ people who require that the data be in a different format, or they use different\
  \ mapping software. \n\nPlease note that you may experience issues when submitting\
  \ requests to the delivery or test environment if using this [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/bcgov/api-specs/tree/master/geomark)\
