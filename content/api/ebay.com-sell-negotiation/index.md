description: "The <b>Negotiations API</b> gives sellers the ability to proactively\
  \ send discount offers to buyers who have shown an \"interest\" in their listings.\
  \  <br><br>By sending buyers discount offers on listings where they have shown an\
  \ interest, sellers can increase the velocity of their sales.  <br><br>There are\
  \ various ways for a buyer to show <i>interest </i> in a listing. For example, if\
  \ a buyer adds the listing to their <b>Watch</b> list, or if they add the listing\
  \ to their shopping cart and later abandon the cart, they are deemed to have shown\
  \ an interest in the listing.  <br><br>In the offers that sellers send, they can\
  \ discount their listings by either a percentage off the listing price, or they\
  \ can set a new discounted price that is lower than the original listing price.\
  \  <br><br>For details about how seller offers work, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/offers-to-buyers.html\"\
