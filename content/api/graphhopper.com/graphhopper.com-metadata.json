  "description" : "\nWith the [GraphHopper Directions API](https://www.graphhopper.com/products/) you can integrate A-to-B route planning, turn-by-turn navigation,\nroute optimization, isochrone calculations and other tools in your application.\n\nThe GraphHopper Directions API consists of the following RESTful web services:\n\n * [Routing API](#tag/Routing-API),\n * [Route Optimization API](#tag/Route-Optimization-API),\n * [Isochrone API](#tag/Isochrone-API),\n * [Map Matching API](#tag/Map-Matching-API),\n * [Matrix API](#tag/Matrix-API),\n * [Geocoding API](#tag/Geocoding-API) and\n * [Cluster API](#tag/Cluster-API).\n\n# Explore our APIs\n\n## Get started\n\n1. [Sign up for GraphHopper](https://support.graphhopper.com/a/solutions/articles/44001976025)\n2. [Create an API key](https://support.graphhopper.com/a/solutions/articles/44001976027)\n\nEach API part has its own documentation. Jump to the desired API part and learn about the API through the given examples and tutorials.\n\nIn addition, for each API there are specific sample requests that you can send via Insomnia or Postman to see what the requests and responses look like.\n\n## Insomnia\n\nTo explore our APIs with [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Insomnia and Import [our workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/directions-api-doc/master/web/restclients/GraphHopper-Direction-API-Insomnia.json).\n2. Specify [your API key](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/register) in your workspace: Manage Environments -> Base Environment -> `\"api_key\": your API key`\n3. Start exploring\n\n![Insomnia](./img/insomnia.png)\n\n## Postman\n\nTo explore our APIs with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), follow these steps:\n\n1. Import our [request collections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/directions-api-doc/master/web/restclients/graphhopper_directions_api.postman_collection.json) as well as our [environment file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/directions-api-doc/master/web/restclients/graphhopper_directions_api.postman_environment.json).\n2. Specify [your API key](https://graphhopper.com/dashboard/#/register) in your environment: `\"api_key\": your API key`\n3. Start exploring\n\n![Postman](./img/postman.png)\n\n## API Client Libraries\n\nTo speed up development and make coding easier, we offer the following client libraries:\n\n * [JavaScript client](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-js-client) - try the [live examples](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/examples/)\n * [Others](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-clients) like C#, Ruby, PHP, Python, ... automatically created for the Route Optimization API\n\n### Bandwidth reduction\n\nIf you create your own client, make sure it supports http/2 and gzipped responses for best speed.\n\nIf you use the Matrix, the Route Optimization API or the Cluster API and want to solve large problems, we recommend you to reduce bandwidth\nby [compressing your POST request](https://gist.github.com/karussell/82851e303ea7b3459b2dea01f18949f4)\nand specifying the header as follows: `Content-Encoding: gzip`. This will also avoid the HTTP 413 error \"Request Entity Too Large\".\n\n## Contact Us\n\nIf you have problems or questions, please read the following information:\n\n- [FAQ](https://graphhopper.com/api/1/docs/FAQ/)\n- [Public forum](https://discuss.graphhopper.com/c/directions-api)\n- [Contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/)\n- [GraphHopper Status Page](https://status.graphhopper.com/)\n\nTo stay informed about the latest developments, you can\n\n- follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/graphhopper/),\n- read [our blog](https://graphhopper.com/blog/),\n- watch [our documentation repository](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-doc),\n- sign up for our newsletter or\n- [our forum](https://discuss.graphhopper.com/c/directions-api).\n\nSelect the channel you like the most.\n\n\n# Map Data and Routing Profiles\n\nCurrently, our main data source is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org). We also integrated other network data providers.\nThis chapter gives an overview about the options you have.\n\n## OpenStreetMap\n\n#### Geographical Coverage\n\n[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) covers the whole world. If you want to see for yourself if we can provide data suitable for your region,\nplease visit [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/).\nYou can edit and modify OpenStreetMap data if you find that important information is missing, e.g. a weight limit for a bridge.\n[Here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide) is a beginner's guide that shows how to add data. If you have edited data, we usually consider your data after 1 week at the latest.\n\n#### Supported Vehicle Profiles\n\nThe Routing, Matrix and Route Optimization APIs support the following vehicle profiles:\n\nName       | Description           | Restrictions              | Icon\n-----------|:----------------------|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------\ncar        | Car mode              | car access                | ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png)\nsmall_truck| Small truck like a Mercedes Sprinter, Ford Transit or Iveco Daily | height=2.7m, width=2+0.4m, length=5.5m, weight=2080+1400 kg | ![small truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/small_truck.png)\ntruck      | Truck like a MAN or Mercedes-Benz Actros | height=3.7m, width=2.6+0.5m, length=12m, weight=13000 + 13000 kg, hgv=yes, 3 Axes | ![truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/truck.png)\nscooter    | Moped mode | Fast inner city, often used for food delivery, is able to ignore certain bollards, maximum speed of roughly 50km/h | ![scooter image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/scooter.png)\nfoot       | Pedestrian or walking without dangerous [SAC-scales](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:sac_scale) | foot access         | ![foot image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/foot.png)\nhike       | Pedestrian or walking with priority for more beautiful hiking tours and potentially a bit longer than `foot`. Walking duration is influenced by elevation differences.  | foot access         | ![hike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/hike.png)\nbike       | Trekking bike avoiding hills | bike access  | ![bike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/bike.png)\nmtb        | Mountainbike          | bike access         | ![Mountainbike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/mtb.png)\nracingbike| Bike preferring roads | bike access         | ![racingbike image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/racingbike.png)\n\nPlease note:\n\n * all motor vehicles (`car`, `small_truck`, `truck` and `scooter`) support turn restrictions via `turn_costs=true`\n * the free package supports only the vehicle profiles `car`, `bike` or `foot`\n * up to 2 different vehicle profiles can be used in a single optimization request. The number of vehicles is unaffected and depends on your subscription.\n * we offer custom vehicle profiles with different properties, different speed profiles or different access options. To find out more about custom profiles, please [contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/).\n * a sophisticated `motorcycle` profile is available up on request. It is powered by the [Kurviger](https://kurviger.de/en) Routing API and favors curves and slopes while avoiding cities and highways.\n \n## TomTom\n\nIf you want to include traffic, you can purchase the TomTom Add-on.\nThis Add-on only uses TomTom's road network and historical traffic information.\nLive traffic is not yet considered. If you are interested to learn how we consider traffic information, we recommend that you read [this article](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2017/11/06/time-dependent-optimization/).\n\nPlease note the following:\n\n * Currently we only offer this for our [Route Optimization API](#tag/Route-Optimization-API).\n * In addition to our terms, you need to accept TomTom's [End User License Aggreement](https://www.graphhopper.com/tomtom-end-user-license-agreement/).\n * We do *not* use TomTom's web services. We only use their data with our software.\n \n[Contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/) for more details.\n\n#### Geographical Coverage\n\nWe offer\n\n- Europe including Russia\n- North, Central and South America\n- Saudi Arabia\n- United Arab Emirates\n- South Africa\n- Australia\n\n#### Supported Vehicle Profiles\n\nName       | Description           | Restrictions              | Icon\n-----------|:----------------------|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------\ncar        | Car mode              | car access                | ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png)\nsmall_truck| Small truck like a Mercedes Sprinter, Ford Transit or Iveco Daily | height=2.7m, width=2+0.4m, length=5.5m, weight=2080+1400 kg | ![small truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/small_truck.png)\n",
