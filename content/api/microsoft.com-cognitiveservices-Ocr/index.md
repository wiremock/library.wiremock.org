  \ image contains mature content, or it can be used to find all the faces in an image.\
  \  It also has other features like estimating dominant and accent colors, categorizing\
  \ the content of images, and describing an image with complete English sentences.\
  \  Additionally, it can also intelligently generate images thumbnails for displaying\
  \ large images effectively."
