description: "The PTV Timetable API provides direct access to Public Transport Victoriaâ€™\
  s public transport timetable data.\r\n\r\nThe API returns scheduled timetable, route\
  \ and stop data for all metropolitan and regional train, tram and bus services in\
  \ Victoria, including Night Network(Night Train and Night Tram data are included\
  \ in metropolitan train and tram services data, respectively, whereas Night Bus\
  \ is a separate route type).\r\n\r\nThe API also returns real-time data for metropolitan\
  \ train, tram and bus services (where this data is made available to PTV), as well\
  \ as disruption information, stop facility information, and access to myki ticket\
  \ outlet data.\r\n\r\nThis Swagger is for Version 3 of the PTV Timetable API. By\
  \ using this documentation you agree to comply with the licence and terms of service.\r\
  \n\r\nTrain timetable data is updated daily, while the remaining data is updated\
  \ weekly, taking into account any planned timetable changes (for example, due to\
  \ holidays or planned disruptions). The PTV timetable API is the same API used by\
  \ PTV for its apps. To access the most up to date data PTV has (including real-time\
  \ data) you must use the API dynamically.\r\n\r\nYou can access the PTV Timetable\
  \ API through a HTTP or HTTPS interface, as follows:\r\n\r\n    base URL / version\
  \ number / API name / query string\r\nThe base URL is either:\r\n  *  http://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au\r\
  \nor\r\n  *  https://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au\r\n\r\nThe Swagger JSON file is\
  \ available at http://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au/swagger/docs/v3\r\n\r\nFrequently\
  \ asked questions are available on the PTV website at http://ptv.vic.gov.au/apifaq\r\
