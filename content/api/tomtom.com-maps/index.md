description: "The Maps API web services suite offers the following APIs:\n  - Raster\n\
  \  The Maps Raster API renders map data that is divided into gridded sections called\
  \ tiles. Tiles are square images (png or jpg format) in various sizes which are\
  \ available at 19 different zoom levels, ranging from 0 to 20. For zoom level 0,\
  \ the entire earth is displayed on one single tile, while at zoom level 20, the\
  \ world is divided into 2<sup>40</sup> tiles.\n  - Vector\n  Similar to Maps Raster\
  \ API, the Maps Vector API serves data on different zoom level ranging from 0 to\
  \ 22. For zoom level 0, the entire earth is displayed on one single tile, while\
  \ at zoom level 22, the world is divided into 2<sup>44</sup> tiles.\n  The Maps\
  \ Vector Service delivers geographic map data packaged in a vector representation\
  \ of squared sections called vector tiles. Each tile includes pre-defined collections\
  \ of map features (points, lines, road shapes, water polygons, building footprints,\
  \ ect.) delivered in one of the specified vector formats. Format of the tile is\
  \ formally described using protobuf schema."
