description: "This API provides a similarity key used to match with other similar\
  \ company name data, including for purposes of deduplication, fuzzy matching, or\
  \ merging of datasets. A much higher match rate will be achieved by matching on\
  \ the algorithmically generated similarity key rather than the data itself."
