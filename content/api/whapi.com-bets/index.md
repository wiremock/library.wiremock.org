title: "Bets API"
provider: "whapi.com"
description: "The Bets API methods are used to place single, multiple and complex\
  \ bets and to retrieve a customer’s bet history. When retrieving a customer’s bet\
  \ history you can organize the bets from the betting history in terms of date, bet\
  \ type and whether the bet is settled or not. You can also specify what fields to\
  \ be included/excluded or return a list of all default fields the method returns.\
  \ <br /><br /> The Bets API will also generate a bet delay if you’re placing a single/multiple\
  \ bet in-Play by creating a time margin to negate the effects of major changes to\
  \ the market (for example, goals during a football match). Note that in version\
  \ 2 of our APIs, Bets API contains the functionality of both Bets API v1 and the\
  \ Betslips API v1."
