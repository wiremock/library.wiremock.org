description: "Use the VA Forms API to search for VA forms, get the form's PDF link\
  \ and metadata, and check for new versions.\n\nVisit our VA Lighthouse [Contact\
  \ Us page](https://developer.va.gov/support) for further assistance.\n\n## Background\n\
  This API offers an efficient way to stay up-to-date with the latest VA forms and\
  \ information. The forms information listed on VA.gov matches the information returned\
  \ by this API.\n- Search by form number, keyword, or title\n- Get a link to the\
  \ form in PDF format\n- Get detailed form metadata including the number of pages,\
  \ related forms, benefit categories, language, and more\n- Retrieve the latest date\
  \ of PDF changes and the SHA256 checksum\n- Identify when a form is deleted by the\
  \ VA\n\n## Technical summary\nThe VA Forms API collects form data from the official\
  \ VA Form Repository on a nightly basis.  The Index endpoint can return all available\
  \ forms or, if an optional query parameter is passed, will return only forms that\
  \ may relate to the query value. When a valid form name is passed to the Show endpoint,\
  \ it will return a single form with additional metadata and full revision history.\
  \ A JSON response is given with the PDF link (if published) and the corresponding\
  \ form metadata.\n\n### Authentication and authorization\nThe form information shared\
  \ by this API is publicly available.  API requests are authorized through a symmetric\
  \ API token, provided in an HTTP header with name apikey. [Get a sandbox API Key](https://developer.va.gov/apply).\n\
  \n### Testing in sandbox environment\nForm data in the sandbox environment is for\
  \ testing your API only, and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. This API also has\
  \ a reduced API rate limit. When you're ready to move to production, be sure to\
  \ [request a production API key.](https://developer.va.gov/go-live)\n\n### SHA256\
  \ revision history\nEach form is checked nightly for recent file changes. A corresponding\
  \ SHA256 checksum is calculated, which provides a record of when the PDF changed\
  \ and the SHA256 hash that was calculated. This allows end users to know that they\
  \ have the most recent version and can verify the integrity of a previously downloaded\
  \ PDF.\n\n### Valid PDF link\nAdditionally, during the nightly refresh process,\
  \ the link to the form PDF is verified and the `valid_pdf` metadata is updated accordingly.\
  \ If marked `true`, the link is valid and is a current form. If marked `false`,\
  \ the link is either broken or the form has been removed.\n\n### Deleted forms\n\
  If the `deleted_at` metadata is set, that means the VA has removed this form from\
  \ the repository and it is no longer to be used.\n"
