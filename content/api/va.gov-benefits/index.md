description: "The Benefits Intake API allows authorized third-party systems used by\
  \ Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs), agencies, and Veterans to digitally submit\
  \ VA benefits claim documents directly to the Veterans Benefits Administration's\
  \ (VBA) claims intake process. This API handles documents related to the following\
  \ benefit claim types: \n\n* Compensation\n* Pension/Survivors Benefits\n* Education\n\
  * Fiduciary\n* Insurance\n* Veteran Readiness & Employment (VRE)\n* Board of Veteran\
  \ Appeals (BVA)\n\nThis API also provides submission status updates until documents\
  \ are successfully established for VBA claim processing, eliminating the need for\
  \ users to switch between systems to manually check whether documents have been\
  \ successfully uploaded.\n\n## Background \nThis API provides a secure, efficient,\
  \ and tracked alternative to mail or fax for VA benefit claim document submissions.\
  \ Documents are uploaded directly to the VBA so they can be processed as quickly\
  \ as possible.\n\n## Technical overview\nThe Benefits Intake API first provides\
  \ an upload location and unique submission identifier, and then accepts a payload\
  \ consisting of a document in PDF format, zero or more optional attachments in PDF\
  \ format, and some JSON metadata. \n\nThe metadata describes the document and attachments,\
  \ and identifies the person for whom it is being submitted. This payload is encoded\
  \ as binary multipart/form-data (not base64). The unique identifier supplied with\
  \ the payload can subsequently be used to request the processing status of the uploaded\
  \ document package.\n\nTo avoid errors and processing delays, API consumers are\
  \ encouraged to validate the `zipcode`,`fileNumber`, `veteranFirstName`, `veteranLastName`\
  \ and `businessLine` fields before submission according to their description in\
  \ the DocumentUploadMetadata model and use the 'businessLine' attribute for the\
  \ most efficient processing. Additionally, please ensure no PDF user passwords are\
  \ used in submitted PDFs. \n\n### Attachment & file size limits\nThere is no limit\
  \ on the number of files a payload can contain, but size limits do apply.\n\n* Uploaded\
  \ documents cannot be larger than 21\" x 21\"\n* The entire payload cannot exceed\
  \ 5 GB\n* No single file in a payload can exceed 100 MB\n\n### Date of receipt\n\
  The date that documents are successfully submitted through the Benefits Intake API\
  \ is used as the official VA date of receipt. However, note that until a document\
  \ status of `received`, `processing`, `success`, or `vbms` is returned, a client\
  \ cannot consider the document received by VA. \n\nA status of `received` means\
  \ that the document package has been transmitted, but may not be validated. Any\
  \ errors with the document package, such as unreadable PDFs or a Veteran not found,\
  \ will cause the status to change to `error`.\n\nIf the document status is `error`,\
  \ VA has not received the submission and cannot honor the submission date as the\
  \ date of receipt.\n\n### Authentication and Authorization\nAPI requests are authorized\
  \ through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name 'apikey'.\
  \ [Request an API key.](https://developer.va.gov/apply)\n\n### Testing in the sandbox\
  \ environment\nIn the sandbox environment, the final status of a submission is `received`\
  \ and submissions do not actually progress to the central mail repository or VBMS.\
  \ \n\nProgress beyond the `received` status can be simulated for testing. We allow\
  \ passing in a `Status-Override` header on the `/uploads/{id}` endpoint so that\
  \ you can change the status of your submission to simulate the various scenarios.\
  \ \n\nThe available statuses are `pending`, `uploaded`, `received`, `processing`,\
  \ `success`, `vbms`, and `error`. The meaning of the various statuses is listed\
  \ below in Models under DocumentUploadStatusAttributes.\n\n### Test data\nWe use\
  \ mock test data in the sandbox environment. Data is not sent upstream and it is\
  \ not necessary to align submitted test data with any other systems' data.\n\n###\
  \ Validating documents\nUse the POST `/uploads/validate_document` endpoint to make\
  \ sure your documents will pass system file requirements and\nvalidations before\
  \ you send them through the submissions process. This step is optional but decreases\
  \ the likelihood\nof individual document errors during the submission process.\n\
  \nValidations performed:\n* Document is a valid PDF (Note: `Content-Type` header\
  \ value must be \"application/pdf\")\n* Document does not have a user password (an\
  \ owner password is acceptable)\n* File size does not exceed 100 MB\n* Page size\
  \ does not exceed 21\" x 21\"\n\n### Upload operation\nAllows a client to upload\
  \ a multi-part document package (form + attachments + metadata).\n\n1. Client Request:\
  \ POST https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/vba_documents/v1/\n    * No request body\
  \ or parameters required\n\n2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the following\
  \ attributes:\n    * `guid`: An identifier used for subsequent status requests\n\
  \    * `location`: A URL to which the actual document package payload can be submitted\
  \ in the next step. The URL is specific to this upload request, and should not be\
  \ re-used for subsequent uploads. The URL is valid for 900 seconds (15 minutes)\
  \ from the time of this response. If the location is not used within 15 minutes,\
  \ the GUID will expire. Once expired, status checks on the GUID will return a status\
  \ of `expired`.\n        * Note: If, after you've submitted a document, the status\
  \ hasn't changed to `uploaded` before 15 minutes has elapsed, we recommend retrying\
  \ the upload in order to make sure the document properly reaches our servers. If\
  \ the upload continues to fail, try encoding the payload as Base64 (See below).\n\
  \n 3. Client Request: PUT to the location URL returned in Step 2.\n    * Request\
  \ body should be encoded as binary multipart/form-data (base64 also available -\
  \ see details below), equivalent to that generated by an HTML form submission or\
  \ using \"curl -Fâ€¦\". The format is described in more detail below.\n    * No `apikey`\
  \ authorization header is required for this request, as authorization is embedded\
  \ in the signed location URL.\n\n4. Service Response: The HTTP status indicates\
  \ whether the upload was successful.\n    * Additionally, the response includes\
  \ an ETag header containing an MD5 hash of the submitted payload. This can be compared\
  \ to the submitted payload to ensure data integrity of the upload.\n\n### Status\
  \ caching\nDue to current system limitations, data for the `/uploads/report` endpoint\
  \ is cached for one hour.\n\nA request to the `/uploads/{id}` endpoint will return\
  \ a real-time status for that GUID, and update its status in `/uploads/report`.\n\
  \nThe `updated_at` field indicates the last time the status for a given GUID was\
  \ updated.\n\n### Document Submission Statuses\n**Important note:** a submission\
  \ has not been received by VA until it has a status of Received, Processing, Success,\
  \ \nor VBMS. Detailed descriptions of what each status means are found in this table.\n\
  \n| Status        | What it means |\n| ---           |     ---     |\n| **Pending**\
  \   | Initial status.<br /><br />Indicates no document package has been uploaded\
  \ yet.<br /><br />Date of Receipt is not yet established with this status |\n| **Uploaded**\
  \  | Indicates document package has been successfully uploaded (PUT) from your system\
  \ to the API server but has not yet been validated.<br /><br />Date of Receipt is\
  \ not yet established with this status. Any errors with the document package, such\
  \ as having an unreadable PDF, may cause an Error status. |\n| **Received**  | Indicates\
  \ document package has been received upstream of the API and is awaiting Processing.<br\
  \ /><br />The VA Date of Receipt is set when this status is achieved.<br /><br />This\
  \ is the final status in the sandbox environment unless further progress is simulated.\
  \ |\n| **Processing**| Indicates the document package is being validated, processed,\
  \ and made ready to route and work. |\n| **Success**   | Indicates the document\
  \ package has been successfully received within VA's mail handling system.<br /><br\
  \ />Success is the final status for a small percentage of submitted packages with\
  \ claim types, Veteran types, or exception processes that are not worked in VBMS.\
  \ Most submissions reach a Success status within 1 business day. A small portion\
  \ will take longer; however, some submissions may take up to 2 weeks to reach a\
  \ Success status. |\n| **VBMS**      | Indicates this document package was successfully\
  \ uploaded into a Veteran's eFolder within VBMS.<br /><br />On average, submissions\
  \ reach VBMS status within 3 business days; however, processing times vary and some\
  \ submissions may remain in a Success status for several weeks before reaching a\
  \ VBMS status.<br /><br />Some document packages are worked in VA systems other\
  \ than VBMS. For these submissions, Success is the final status. |\n| **Error**\
  \     | Indicates that there was an error. Refer to the error code and message for\
  \ further information. |\n| **Expired**   | After a POST request, there is a 15-minute\
  \ window during which documents must be uploaded via a PUT request.<br /><br />An\
  \ Expired status means the documents were not successfully uploaded within this\
  \ 15-minute window. We recommend coding to retry unsuccessful uploads within 15\
  \ minutes using the same submission in case of connection issues. |\n\n### Optional\
  \ Base64 encoding\n\nBase64 is an encoding scheme that converts binary data into\
  \ text format, so that encoded textual data can be easily transported over networks\
  \ uncorrupted and without data loss. \n\nBase64 can be used to encode binary multipart/form-data\
  \ it in its entirety.  Note that the whole payload must be encoded, not individual\
  \ parts/attachments.\n\nAfter encoding your payload, you'll be required to preface\
  \ your base64 string with `data:multipart/form-data;base64,` in order to allow our\
  \ system to distinguish the file type. Your final string payload would look something\
  \ like `data:multipart/form-data;base64,(encryption string)==` and close with the\
  \ standard == marker.  Note that the multipart boundaries i.e. -----WebKitFormBoundaryVfOwzCyvug0JmWYo\
  \ and ending ------WebKitFormBoundaryVfOwzCyvug0JmWYo- must also be included.\n\n\
