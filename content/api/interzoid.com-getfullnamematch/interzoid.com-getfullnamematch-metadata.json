  "description" : "This API provides a similarity key used to match with other similar full name data, including for purposes of deduplication, fuzzy matching, or merging of datasets. A much higher match rate will be achieved by matching on the similarity key rather than the data itself. This API is for full name data where first and last name are in the same field. Use the Full Name Parsed Similarity Key API for first and last name data that are in separate fields.",
