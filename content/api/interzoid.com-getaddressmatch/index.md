description: "This API provides a similarity key used to match with other similar\
  \ street address data, including for purposes of deduplication, fuzzy matching,\
  \ or merging of datasets. A much higher match rate will be achieved by matching\
  \ on the algorithmically generated similarity key rather than the data itself."
