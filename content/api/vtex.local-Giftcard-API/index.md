description: ">ℹ️ Onboarding guide\r\n>\r\n> Check the new [Payments onboarding guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/payments-overview).\
  \ We created this guide to improve the onboarding experience for developers at VTEX.\
  \ It assembles all documentation on our Developer Portal about Payments and is organized\
  \ by focusing on the developer's journey.\r\n\r\nThe Gift Card is a payment method\
  \ configured as a cash value associated with a client. It is used to grant a discount\
  \ on the value of the order at the store.\r\n\r\n> ⚠ A Gift Card works as a **payment\
  \ method**, not a promotion."
