description: "Visual Search API lets you discover insights about an image such as\
  \ visually similar images, shopping sources, and related searches. The API can also\
  \ perform text recognition, identify entities (people, places, things), return other\
  \ topical content for the user to explore, and more. For more information, see [Visual\
  \ Search Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/overview).\
  \  **NOTE:** To comply with the new EU Copyright Directive in France, the Bing Visual\
  \ Search API must omit some content from certain EU News sources for French users.\
  \ The removed content may include thumbnail images and videos, video previews, and\
  \ snippets which accompany search results from these sources. As a consequence,\
  \ the Bing APIs may serve fewer results with thumbnail images and videos, video\
  \ previews, and snippets to French users."
