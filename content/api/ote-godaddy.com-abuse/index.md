description: "<strong>GoDaddy Abuse API Terms of Use:</strong><p>GoDaddy’s Abuse API\
  \ is provided to simplify and standardize the abuse reporting experience. To help\
  \ us streamline the review of abuse reports, you acknowledge and agree that your\
  \ use of GoDaddy’s Abuse API is subject to the following quality metrics and terms\
  \ of use.</p><p>GoDaddy may, in its sole and absolute discretion, change or modify\
  \ these terms, and such changes or modifications shall be effective immediately\
  \ upon notice to you. Your use of GoDaddy’s Abuse API after such changes or modifications\
  \ shall constitute your acceptance of these terms as last revised. If you do not\
  \ agree to be bound by these terms as last revised, do not use (or continue to use)\
  \ our Abuse API.</p><p>As an Abuse API user, you must only submit abuse reports\
  \ via the API portal and cease all email submissions, including but not limited,\
  \ to phishing@godaddy.com, netabuse@godaddy.com, malware@godaddy.com, or spam@godaddy.com,\
  \ etc.  Any additional or duplicate submission outside of the API portal will be\
  \ deprioritized for review. Submissions related to trademark, copyright or content\
  \ issues may still be sent to trademarkclaims@godaddy.com, coyprightclaims@godaddy.com,\
  \ and contentcomplaints@godaddy.com, respectively. Our [Front of Site](https://supportcenter.godaddy.com/AbuseReport)\
  \ also describes other scenarios not covered by the API.</p><p>When you submit abuse\
  \ reports via GoDaddy’s Abuse API, you must ensure that you accurately categorize\
  \ the abuse type of each report to match our definitions in the API documentations\
  \ provided to you. Any submission that fails to match our definitions or is miscategorized\
  \ will be marked as a false positive. Examples include, but are not limited to,\
  \ submissions of trademark complaints marked as phishing or malware, or submissions\
  \ of copyright complaints marked as phishing or malware, etc.</p><p>If, at any time,\
  \ the false positive rate of submissions exceeds 40% of your total submissions,\
  \ as determined by GoDaddy, GoDaddy may in its sole discretion deprioritize any\
  \ subsequent reports submitted by you and/or your organization.</p><p>You acknowledge\
  \ and agree that submitting every URL for a single domain is not necessary and will\
  \ not expedite the review process. If your submissions exceed five (5) URLs for\
  \ a single domain, your report will be marked as a duplicate submission taking into\
  \ account that the final outcome of such submissions would yield the same result\
  \ as the original report. GoDaddy may in its sole discretion deprioritize reports\
  \ submitted by you and/or your organization in the event more than 20% of your submissions\
  \ are classified as duplicate submissions.</p><p>You further acknowledge and agree\
  \ that our Customer Support lines are not intended to address abuse reporting matters\
  \ or your use of GoDaddy’s Abuse API. Contacting Customer Support will not expedite\
  \ the review process and may result in abuse reports being deprioritized, to be\
  \ determined in our sole discretion.</p><p>Should you have any questions about GoDaddy’\
  s Abuse API or any of the terms and conditions set forth above, please contact abuseapisupport@godaddy.com.</p>"
