description: "The Catalog API allows users to search for and locate an eBay catalog\
  \ product that is a direct match for the product that they wish to sell. Listing\
  \ against an eBay catalog product helps insure that all listings (based off of that\
  \ catalog product) have complete and accurate information. In addition to helping\
  \ to create high-quality listings, another benefit to the seller of using catalog\
  \ information to create listings is that much of the details of the listing will\
  \ be prefilled, including the listing title, the listing description, the item specifics,\
  \ and a stock image for the product (if available). Sellers will not have to enter\
  \ item specifics themselves, and the overall listing process is a lot faster and\
  \ easier."
