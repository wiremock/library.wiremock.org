description: "This API provides a similarity key used to match with other similar\
  \ city name data, including for purposes of deduplication, fuzzy matching, or merging\
  \ of datasets. A much higher match rate will be achieved by matching on the algorithmically\
  \ generated similarity key rather than the data itself."
