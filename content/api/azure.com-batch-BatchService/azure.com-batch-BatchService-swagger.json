When shrinking a Pool, the Batch service tries to preserve Nodes where Job Manager Tasks are running for as long as possible (that is, Compute Nodes running 'normal' Tasks are removed before Compute Nodes running Job Manager Tasks). When a Job Manager Task fails and needs to be restarted, the system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle Compute Nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running Tasks in the Pool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager Task to restart. Note that a Job Manager Task in one Job does not have priority over Tasks in other Jobs. Across Jobs, only Job level priorities are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 Job needs to be restarted, it will not displace Tasks of a priority 1 Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing."

        "description" : "You can use Job Preparation to prepare a Node to run Tasks for the Job. Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include: Downloading common resource files used by all the Tasks in the Job. The Job Preparation Task can download these common resource files to the shared location on the Node. (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR\\shared), or starting a local service on the Node so that all Tasks of that Job can communicate with it. If the Job Preparation Task fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before exiting with exit code 0), Batch will not run Tasks of this Job on the Node. The Compute Node remains ineligible to run Tasks of this Job until it is reimaged. The Compute Node remains active and can be used for other Jobs. The Job Preparation Task can run multiple times on the same Node. Therefore, you should write the Job Preparation Task to handle re-execution. If the Node is rebooted, the Job Preparation Task is run again on the Compute Node before scheduling any other Task of the Job, if rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job Preparation Task did not previously complete. If the Node is reimaged, the Job Preparation Task is run again before scheduling any Task of the Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing."

The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. For Pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for Pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication. For Pools created with a virtual machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For Pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage on port 443.
