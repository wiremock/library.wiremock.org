description: "Use these REST APIs for performing operations on Group entity in your\
  \ Azure API Management deployment. Groups are used to manage the visibility of products\
  \ to developers. Each API Management service instance comes with the following immutable\
  \ system groups whose membership is automatically managed by API Management.  -\
  \ **Administrators** - Azure subscription administrators are members of this group.\
  \ - **Developers** - Authenticated developer portal users fall into this group.\
  \ - **Guests** - Unauthenticated developer portal users are placed into this group.\
  \ In addition to these system groups, administrators can create custom groups or\
  \ [leverage external groups in associated Azure Active Directory tenants](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-aad#how-to-add-an-external-azure-active-directory-group).\
  \ Custom and external groups can be used alongside system groups in giving developers\
  \ visibility and access to API products. For example, you could create one custom\
  \ group for developers affiliated with a specific partner organization and allow\
  \ them access to the APIs from a product containing relevant APIs only. A user can\
  \ be a member of more than one group."
