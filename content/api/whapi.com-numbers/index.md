description: "The William Hill Numbers API uses a single method that allows you to\
  \ generate random numbers for your application. Numbers can either be unique or\
  \ can be produced with the chance that some might be the same. For example, you\
  \ can have a highest value of 6 and a lowest value of 1 with a count of 2 with a\
  \ unique value of false - this will give you two numbers between 1 and 6 which are\
  \ independent, just like two dice being rolled.<br /><br />The Numbers API is a\
  \ Private API and therefore not automatically available to developers. To use this\
  \ API, contact your business manager who will guide you through the separate Terms\
  \ and Conditions of use before you can have the API assigned to your application."
