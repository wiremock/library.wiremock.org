It also returns the RESTful item ID, which you can use with all the Buy API methods.

An item group is an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. When an item group is created, one of the item variations, such as the red shirt size L, is chosen as the &quot;parent&quot;. All the other items in the group are the children, such as the blue shirt size L, red shirt size M, etc. The fieldgroups URI parameter lets you control what is returned in the response.

See Product for more information about these fields. COMPACT - This returns only the following fields, which let you quickly check if the availability or price of the item has changed, if the item has been revised by the seller, or if an item's top-rated plus status has changed for items you have stored. itemId - The identifier of the item. itemAffiliateWebURL - The URL of the View Item page of the item, which includes the affiliate tracking ID. This field is only returned if the eBay partner enables affiliate tracking for the item by including the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header in the method. ItemWebURL - The URL of the View Item page of the item. This enables you to include a &quot;Report Item on eBay&quot; link that takes the buyer to the View Item page on eBay.

This is the traditional/legacy ID that is often seen in the URL of the listing View Item page. sellerItemRevision - An identifier generated/incremented when a seller revises the item.

This ID is changed only when the seller makes a change to the item. This means you cannot use this value to determine if the quantity has changed. To check if the quantity has changed, use estimatedAvailabilities. topRatedBuyingExperience - A boolean value indicating if this item is a top-rated plus item. A change in the item's top rated plus standing is not tracked by the revision ID. See topRatedBuyingExperience for more information. price - This is tracked by the revision ID but is returned here to enable you to quickly verify the price of the item. estimatedAvailabilities - Returns the item availability information, which is based on the item's quantity. Note: Changes in quantity are not tracked by sellerItemRevision. itemEndDate - This is the scheduled end time of the listing. eligibleForInlineCheckout - This parameter returns items based on whether or not the items can be purchased using the Buy Order API. If the value of this field is true, this indicates that the item can be purchased using the Order API. If the value of this field is false, this indicates that the item cannot be purchased using the Order API and must be purchased on the eBay site.

If the revision number is different from the value you have stored, update the value and pass in the item ID in the getItem method to get the latest information. If the sellerItemRevision field is not returned or has not changed, where needed, update the item information with the information returned in the response.

You can search by keyword, category, eBay product ID (ePID), or GTIN, charity ID, or a combination of these. Note: Only FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items are returned by default. However, this method does return items where both FIXED_PRICE and AUCTION are available as a buying option. After a bid has been placed, items become active auction items and are no longer returned by default, but they remain accessible by filtering for the AUCTION buying option. This method also supports the following: Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more. For the fields supported by this method, see the filter parameter. Retrieving the refinements (metadata) of an item , such as item aspects (color, brand), condition, category, etc. using the fieldgroups parameter. Filtering by item aspects and other refinements using the aspect_filter parameter. Filtering for items that are compatible with a specific product, using the compatibility_filter parameter. Creating aspects histograms, which enables shoppers to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results. For details and examples of these capabilities, see Browse API in the Buying Integration Guide. Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls (limit and offset fields) and sort query parameters that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. For more information about Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match.

You can sort items by price (in ascending or descending order) or by distance (only applicable if the &quot;pickup&quot; filters are used, and only ascending order is supported). You can also sort items by listing date, with the most recently listed (newest) items appearing first. Note: To sort in descending order, insert a hyphen (-) before the field name. If no sort parameter is submitted, the result set is sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. The following are examples of using the sort query parameter. Sort Result sort=price Sorts by price in ascending order (lowest price first) sort=-price Sorts by price in descending order (highest price first) sort=distance Sorts by distance in ascending order (shortest distance first) sort=newlyListed Sorts by listing date (most recently listed/newest items first) Default: Ascending For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/browse/types/cos:SortField",
